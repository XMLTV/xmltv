# prog_titles_to_process

# $Id$
#
# This file contains programme titles that should be processed in order to 
# produce more consistent programme titles and subtitles. Some programme
# entries in the listings data from the Radio Times contain subtitle/episode 
# information in the title field, others may contain the programme title
# and subtitle reversed, and yet more may contain 'season' information that is
# not part of the programme title. When these entries have a colon separating
# the title and subtitle components, we use the colon to split the title and 
# subtitle accordingly.
#
# By default, the tv_grab_uk_rt grabber will read this file and process any 
# matching programme titles found in the listings data against the flagged
# titles below. Title processing can be disabled using the '--no-title-updates'
# option.
#
# Each programme title to process is listed below, with one title per line.
# Comments are allowed and ignored. Each entry contains 2 pipe-delimited 
# fields, the first of which should contain a procesing code, and the second
# the programme title entry or non-title text seen in the Radio Times data. 
# How the entry is processed depends upon the value of the processing code in
# the first field. Processing codes used are:
# follows:
#
# 1) The text in the second field is non-title text that is to be removed from
#    any programme titles found containing this text at the beginning of the 
#    <title> element, separated from the actual title with a colon.
#
# 2) The text in the second field is the desired title of a programme when the 
#    raw listings data contains both the programme's title _and_ episode in 
#    the title ($title:$episode). We reassign the episode information to the 
#    <episode> element, leaving only the programme title in the <title> element.
#
# 3) The text in the second field is the desired title of a programme when the
#    raw listings data contains both the programme's episode _and_ title in
#    the title ($episode:$title). We reassign the episode information to the
#    <episode> element, leaving only the programme title in the <title> element.
#
# 4) The text in the second field is the desired title of a programme which is 
#    listed in the raw listings data as the programme's episode (i.e. the title
#    and episode details have been reversed). We therefore reverse the 
#    assignment to ensure the <title> and <episode> elements contain the correct
#    information.

# Non-title information to remove from beginning of titles
