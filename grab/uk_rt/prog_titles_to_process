######################## COPYRIGHT NOTICE '####################################
#
# NOTE: The Radio Times (and others) have copyright over the description
#       text used in listings. Descriptions are included in this file in
#       order to improve the listings uk_rt generates and for no other
#       reason.
#
###############################################################################
#
# This file contains programme titles that should be processed in order to
# produce more consistent programme titles and subtitles. Some programme
# entries in the listings data from the Radio Times contain subtitle/episode
# information in the title field, others may contain the programme title
# and subtitle reversed, and yet more may contain 'season' information that is
# not part of the programme title. When these entries have a colon separating
# the title and subtitle components, we use the colon to split the title and
# subtitle accordingly. We also flag specific programme titles that are given
# inconsistently across channels, and provide a consistent title to use in these
# cases.
#
# By default, the tv_grab_uk_rt grabber will read this file and process any
# matching programme titles found in the listings data against the flagged
# titles below. Title processing can be disabled during configuration.
#
# Each programme title to process is listed below, with one title per line.
# Comments are allowed and ignored. Each entry contains 2 pipe-delimited
# fields, the first of which should contain a procesing code, the second
# the programme title entry or non-title text seen in the Radio Times data.
# How the entry is processed depends upon the value of the processing code in
# the first field. Processing codes used are:
#
# 1)  The text in the second field is non-title text that is to be removed from
#     any programme titles found containing this text at the beginning of the
#     <title> element, separated from the actual title with a colon.
#
# 2)  The text in the second field is the desired title of a programme when the
#     raw listings data contains both the programme's title _and_ episode in
#     the title ($title:$episode). We reassign the episode information to the
#     <episode> element, leaving only the programme title in the <title> element.
#
# 3)  The text in the second field is the desired title of a programme when the
#     raw listings data contains both the programme's episode _and_ title in
#     the title ($episode:$title). We reassign the episode information to the
#     <episode> element, leaving only the programme title in the <title> element.
#
# 4)  The text in the second field is the desired title of a programme which is
#     listed in the raw listings data as the programme's episode (i.e. the title
#     and episode details have been reversed). We therefore reverse the
#     assignment to ensure the <title> and <episode> elements contain the correct
#     information.
#
# 5)  The text in the second field contains two programme titles, separated by a
#     tilde (~). The first title is the inconsistent programme title to search
#     for during processing, and the second title is a consistent title to
#     as a replacement in the listings output. Programme titles can be
#     inconsistent across channels (e.g. Law and Order vs Law & Order) or use
#     inconsistent grammar (xxxx's vs xxxxs'), so we provide a consistent
#     title, obtained from the programme itself, its website or other media,
#     to use instead.
#
# 6)  The text in the second field contains a programme title and a programme
#     category (genre), separated by a tilde (~). Categories can be assigned
#     to uncategorised programmes (which can be determined by running the grabber
#     with debug output).
#
# 7)  The text in the second field contains a programme title, an old episode
#     value and a new episode value, all separated by tildes (~).
#
# 8)  The text in the second field contains an old programme title, an old episode
#     value, a new programme title and a new episode value. The old and new titles
#     MUST be given, the episode fields can be left empty but the field itself
#     must be present.
#
# 9)  The text in the second field contains a programme title, a new episode
#     value to update, and a description to match against.
#
# 10) The text in the second field contains an old programme title, an old episode
#     value, a new programme title, a new episode value and the episode description.
#     The old and new titles and description MUST be given, the episode fields can
#     be left empty but the field itself must be present.
#
# 11) The text in the second field contains a programme 'brand' and a new title to
#     be extracted from subtitle field and promoted to programme titlei, replacing
#     the brand title. These fields are separated by a tilde (~).
#
# 12) The text in the second field contains a film title and a programme
#     category (genre), separated by a tilde (~). Some film-related programmes are
#     incorrectly flagged as films and should to be re-assigned to a more suitable
#     genre.
#
# 13) The text in the second field contains a programme title and arbitrary text to
#     be removed from the start/end of the programme's subtitle, separated by a
#     tilde (~). If the text to be removed precedes or follows a colon/hyphen, the
#     colon/hyphen is removed also.
#
# Non-title information to remove from beginning of titles
# Works with original title details seen in source

9|A South American Journey with Jonathan Dimbleby~1/3 - Chile and Bolivia~Dimbleby muses and twinkles his way around South America, as he did around Africa and Russia. He again shows his knack for digging out quirky vignettes wherever he goes. The human success stories have just enough journalistic edge: the female wrestlers in Bolivia are part of a struggle for indigenous rights; the astronomer in Chile who shows the stars to poor children is making a point about inequality. Typically, Dimbleby joins in with the wrestlers, dancers and rodeo riders, and cracks nuts in a vast, sweltering Bolivian factory: you may never see a Brazil nut the same way again.

9|Country House Rescue~Chesters, Scottish Borders (Revisit)~It's worth checking the dateline they put on programmes like this. Tonight's edition is a revisit: nothing wrong with that - we could happily revisit the beautiful Chesters Estate in the Scottish Borders again and again. But hold on: in the update tacked on the end, the caption still reads "August 2009". What's happening today, in 2011? That's the update we want now. Have John and Ellie raised the money to renovate their Georgian mansion yet? Or will we have to wait until 2013 to find out? In the meantime, their story and Ruth Watson's intervention are the usual satisfying collision between idealism and business sense. Or as Ruth puts it characteristically, "You have a dream; I have a problem." Radio Times reviewer - David Butcher
