tv_grab_uk_guardian
===================

XMLTV grabber for The Guardian website.



INSTALLATION - Linux
============

Files should be installed in the following locations:

/usr/bin/
---------
tv_grab_uk_guardian   (and make sure it has execute permission)

$HOME/.xmltv/supplement/tv_grab_uk_guardian/
--------------------------------------------
tv_grab_uk_guardian.map.conf



CONFIGURATION
=============

1.
Grabber configuration consists of the usual 
		tv_grab_uk_guardian --configure


2.
The file 'tv_grab_uk_guardian.map.conf' has two purposes.  Firstly you can map the channel ids used by the site into something more meaningful to your PVR.  E.g.
		map==bbc-1-south==BBC 1
will change 'bbc-1-south' to 'BBC 1' in the output XML.

Note: the lines are of the form "map=={channel id}=={my name}".

The second purpose is to likewise translate genre names.  So if your PVR doesn't have a category for 'Science Fiction' but uses 'Sci-fi' instead, then you can specify
		cat==Science Fiction==Sci-fi
and the output XML will have 'Sci-fi'.


IMPORTANT: the downloaded 'tv_grab_uk_guardian.map.conf' contains example lines to illustrate the format - you should edit this file to suit your own purposes!



USAGE
=====

All the normal XMLTV capabilities are included.

For extended help information run

	      tv_grab_uk_guardian --info
		
		

VALIDATION
==========

tv_validate_grabber may report an error similar to:

	     "Line 5 Invalid channel-id 'BBC 1'"
	
This is a bug in ValidateFile.pm (lines 201-202) which insists the channel-id adheres to RFC2838 despite the xmltv.dtd only saying "preferably" not "SHOULD".  
(Having channel ids of the form "bbc1.bbc.co.uk" will be rejected by many PVRs since they require the data to match their own list.)


It may also report 

	     "tv_sort failed on the concatenated data. Probably due to overlapping data between days."
	
This is a bug in ValidateGrabber.pm (lines 348-353) which insists on the data retrieved being 00:00-23:59 during its "notadditive" test:

	     "grabbing data for tomorrow first and then for the day after tomorrow and
	     concatenating them does not yield the same result as grabbing the data
	     for tomorrow and the day after tomorrow at once."
	

Both these errors can be ignored.

	     "Grabber validated ok."
