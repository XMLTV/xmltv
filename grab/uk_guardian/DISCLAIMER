The Guardian website's license for these data does not allow non-personal use.

Certainly any commercial use of listings data obtained by using this grabber will breach copyright law, but if you are just using the data for your own personal use then you are probably fine.

By using this grabber you aver you are using the listings data for your own personal use only and you absolve the author(s) from any liability under copyright law or otherwise.
 

You should be aware that, as with any screen scraping program, the website owner may understandably be upset if they detect your scraping and takes steps to block it (such as by banning your IP address from accessing their site) and, in the worst case, the website owner may change their site to make scraping impractical thereby messing things up for everyone else.

So be respectful in your use of their site: 
(i) Don't run an inordinate number of scrapes, 
(ii) Allow a time interval between retrievals.

Be thankful that they are making these data available. 

In short, play nice!

Thanks.
