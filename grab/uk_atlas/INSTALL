tv_grab_uk_atlas
================

Fetch TV and radio programme listings from Atlas data store and reformat into XMLTV format.



INSTALLATION - Linux
============

Files should be installed in the following locations:

/usr/bin
--------
tv_grab_uk_atlas   (make sure it has execute permission)

$HOME/.xmltv
------------
tv_grab_uk_atlas.conf

$HOME/.xmltv/supplement/tv_grab_uk_atlas
----------------------------------------
tv_grab_uk_atlas.map.conf
tv_grab_uk_atlas.map.genre.conf
atlasAPIkey



CONFIGURATION
=============

1.
First you must obtain an API key from Atlas Metabroadcast.  This is free (at the present time) for personal use and is necessary to allow you to access the full schedule published by the Press Association.  Any commercial use of the data obtained from Atlas will require a paid-for license. 

Instructions are available here: http://metabroadcast.com/blog/getting-full-uk-listings-data-from-atlas-it-s-easy

Once you have your API key then edit the file 'atlasAPIkey' and insert your key as the only line in this file. 


2.
Grabber configuration consists of the usual 
		tv_grab_uk_atlas --configure

Atlas have regionalised data which means you can obtain listings specific to your TV region.  When you run the --configure option you will be asked which viewing platform (e.g. Freeview; Sky HD) and region (e.g. London; South East) you wish to access.  (You can select only 1 region!).

Then you select which channels you want to fetch.


3.
The file 'tv_grab_uk_atlas.map.conf' has two purposes.  Firstly you can map the channel ids used by Atlas into something more meaningful to your PVR.  E.g.
		map==cbdm==FILM4
will change 'cbdm' to 'FILM4' in the output XML.

Note: the lines are of the form "map=={channel id}=={my name}".

The second purpose is to likewise translate genre names.  So if your PVR doesn't have a category for 'Science Fiction' but uses 'Sci-fi' instead, then you can specify
		cat==Science Fiction==Sci-fi
and the output XML will have 'Sci-fi'.


IMPORTANT: the downloaded 'tv_grab_uk_atlas.map.conf' contains example lines to illustrate the format - you should edit this file to suit your own purposes!


4.
The file 'tv_grab_uk_atlas.map.genre.conf' contains mappings from the category codes (genres) used by Press Association into meaningful category names.  You shouldn't need to edit this file.




USAGE
=====

All the normal XMLTV capabilities are included but there is an additional parameter "--hours".  Atlas allows schedule data to be retrieved either by number-of-days or by number-of-hours.

Where possible you should use this 'hours' facility to reduce unnecessary load on the Atlas server.

When --hours is specified the --offset is interpreted as hours.

For example:
	   - to retrieve a schedule for the next 12 hours:

	      tv_grab_uk_atlas --hours 12
	 
	   - to retrieve a schedule for the next 12 hours starting tomorrow:

	      tv_grab_uk_atlas --hours 12 --offset 24


Alternatively you can use the familiar 'days' format:

	      tv_grab_uk_atlas --days 1
	 
	      tv_grab_uk_atlas --days 1 --offset 1


Negative numbers are allowed, so for example the following are valid:

	      tv_grab_uk_atlas --offset -4 --hours 12
	 
	      tv_grab_uk_atlas --offset -1 --days 1

	
Note that Atlas only have data for a maximum 14 days ahead and it varies; some channels have less than this.


An additional parameter "--date YYYYMMDD" allows you to fetch the schedule just for this date. (This is obviously similar to --days 1 with an appropriate --offset but avoids you having to calculate the offset; this is easier for some automated fetchers.)  E.g.

	      tv_grab_uk_atlas --date 20130923


				
A new parameter "--dst" allows you to add an extra hour to the schedule fetched from Atlas.  Some PVRs have trouble with BST times and 'lose' an hour at the end of the day's schedule.  This parameter might help to alleviate that.

	      tv_grab_uk_atlas --days 1 --dst

				

A new parameter "--channel" allows you to override the 'conf' file and retrieve data for a specific channel:

	      tv_grab_uk_atlas --offset -4 --hours 12 --channel cbdm

				

For extended help information run

	      tv_grab_uk_atlas --info
		
		
		

BROWSER INTERFACE
=================

If you wish to run the fetcher via a browser then you can install the cgi script.

(Note you must obviously have a webserver installed or be using a web-host for this to work!).

Copy the file getatlas.pl into the cgi-enabled directory on your web space.  (Hint: This directory is often called "cgi-bin".)  Ensure the file has execute permission.

(Tech note: use a 'normal' cgi handler to run this file; fastcgi may not work.)

Specify the parameters on the URI as follows:
   offset=xxxx
	 hours=xxxx
	 days=xxxx
	 date=YYYYMMDD
	 channel=xxxx
	 dst
	 
	 e.g.   
	    http://my.webspace.com/cgi-bin/getatlas.pl?hours=12
	    http://my.webspace.com/cgi-bin/getatlas.pl?hours=12&offset=6
	    http://my.webspace.com/cgi-bin/getatlas.pl?date=20130930
	    http://my.webspace.com/cgi-bin/getatlas.pl?days=1&dst

Valid combinations are:
	    'offset' and 'hours'
	or  'offset' and 'days'     - in which case the offset is 'days' also (otherwise it's 'hours')
	or  'date'                  - fetch just this day

	



VALIDATION
==========

tv_validate_grabber will report an error similar to:

	     "Line 5 Invalid channel-id 'FILM4'"
	
This is a bug in ValidateFile.pm (lines 201-202) which insists the channel-id adheres to RFC2838 despite the xmltv.dtd only saying "preferably" not "SHOULD".  
(Having channel ids of the form "bbc1.bbc.co.uk" will be rejected by many PVRs since they require the data to match their own list.)


It may also report 

	     "tv_sort failed on the concatenated data. Probably due to overlapping data between days."
	
This is a bug in ValidateGrabber.pm (lines 348-353) which insists on the data retrieved being 00:00-23:59 during its "notadditive" test:

	     "grabbing data for tomorrow first and then for the day after tomorrow and
	     concatenating them does not yield the same result as grabbing the data
	     for tomorrow and the day after tomorrow at once."
	

Both these errors can be ignored.

	     "Grabber validated ok."
