- If you live in Canada or the USA run 'getlistings_na --configure'.
You'll probably find that the current directory is not in your path,
so the command you need to type looks more like:

% ./getlistings_na --configure

Enter your postal / zip code (without any spaces) and choose your
listings provider and channels.  Now run the grabber:

% ./getlistings_na >listings.xml

This will fetch two weeks of listings and write them to stdout, which
is going to a file listings.xml.  The channels data will be written
separately to a file channels.xml.  From now on you can run the
grabber from this directory without reconfiguring.

- If you live in the UK there is no separate configuration step, you
choose the set of channels when you run the grabber
getlistings_uk_ananova.  Run a command like one of:

% ./getlistings_uk_ananova carlton >listings.xml
% ./getlistings_uk_ananova 'tyne tees' >listings.xml
% ./getlistings_uk_ananova satellite >listings.xml
% ./getlistings_uk_ananova meridian radio >listings.xml

The last one of these gets Meridian region television plus radio
listings.

- Now you can do things with these listings like sort them
(sort_listings), print them (listings_to_latex) or select programmes
to watch (sort the listings into tv.xml and run
lynx lynxcgi:pick.cgi).  But for instructions on that you'll have to
read the main documentation at
