## Description

The XMLTV project provides a suite of software to gather television listings, process listings data, and help organize your TV viewing.

XMLTV listings use a mature XML file format for storing TV listings, which is defined and documented in the [XMLTV DTD](xmltv.dtd).

In addition to the many "grabbers" that provide listings for large parts of the world, there are also several tools to process and filter these listings.

Please see our [QuickStart](doc/QuickStart) documentation for details on what each program does.

This is a release of the software as a single Windows binary (xmltv.exe), generated from the Perl source code linked from <https://github.com/XMLTV/xmltv>.

## 64-bit and 32-bit Builds

Please keep an eye on our [releases page](https://github.com/XMLTV/xmltv/releases) for 64-bit and 32-bit builds of our current releases when available.

All current releases of XMLTV for Windows are built for 64-bit and 32-bit Windows by default. Download the one relevant to your version of Windows - see [How Do I Know if Iâ€™m Running 32-bit or 64-bit Windows?](https://www.howtogeek.com/21726/) - or, if in doubt, simply download the 32-bit version (as it will probably work in all cases). If using the 32-bit version then substitute xmltv32.exe for xmltv.exe in the following instructions.

To build and run a current version yourself you will need to run Cygwin, or Strawberry Perl. [Some instructions are available in the XMLTV Wiki](http://wiki.xmltv.org/index.php/XMLTVWindowsBuild)

## Installation

There is no installer - unpack the zipfile into a directory such as C:\xmltv.  If you are reading this you've probably already done that.

All the different programs are combined into a single executable.  For example, instead of running 'tv_grab_na --days 2 >na.xml' you would run

```bash
c:\xmltv\xmltv.exe tv_grab_na_dd --days 2 --output a.xml
```

Apart from the extra 'xmltv.exe' at the front of each command line, the usage should be the same as the Unix version.  Some programs make use of a "share" directory.  That directory is assumed be named "share" at the same location as the exe.  If you just keep everything where you unzipped it, everything should be fine.  If you must move xmltv.exe, you may need to specify a --share option with some programs.

xmltv.exe will try and guess a timezone.  This usually works fine. If it doesn't, you can set a TZ variable just like on Unix.

## General Notes

Spaces in filenames may cause problems with some programs.  Directories with spaces (i.e. C:\program files\xmltv) are not recommended. C:\xmltv is better.

Some of the programs allow you pass a date format on the command line. This uses % followed by a letter to specify a component of a date, for example %Y gives a four digit year.  This can cause problems on windows since % is used as a shell escape character.

To get around this, use %% to pass a % to the application. (ex. %%Y%%M )

If you *DO* want to insert a shell variable, you can do so by surrounding it with percents. (ex %HOME% )

## Known Issues

The first time xmltv.exe is run, it can take a while... up to 5 minutes as it prepares some files in %TEMP%.  This is normal.  Subsequent runs are fast.

Due to prerequisite problems, EXE support is not currently available for tv_grab_is and tv_grab_it_dvb, If you need one of those you'll need to install Perl and the necessary modules and use the full distribution.

## Proxy Servers

Proxy server support is provided by the LWP modules.

You can define a proxy server via the HTTP_PROXY environment variable:

```bash
http_proxy=http://somehost.somedomain:port
```

For more information, see the [LWP::UserAgent documentation](https://metacpan.org/pod/LWP::UserAgent#PROXY-ATTRIBUTES)
