<!-- DTD for XMLTV lineups

This is a DTD to represent a channel lineup composed of potentially many 
individual channels that are available on a particular TV platform or service. 
Data can be provided in order to uniquely identify a channel based upon its
transmission details (e.g. a service-id for DVB/ATSC channels, or a frequency
for analog channels).

Some of the elements have a 'lang' attribute so that you can store them in 
multiple languages or have mixed languages in a single listing.  This 'lang' 
should be the two-letter code such as 'en' or 'fr_FR'.  Or you can just 
leave it out and let your reader take a guess.

Unless otherwise specified, an element containing CDATA must have some text 
if it is written.

An example XML file for this DTD might look like this:

#FIXME todo...

Unless specified otherwise, textual element content may not contain
newlines - this is to make it easy to convert into line-oriented
formats, and to avoid the question of what exactly a newline would
mean in the middle of someone's name or whatever.  Leading and
trailing whitespace in element content is not significant.

The contents of this DTD correspond to the lineups proposal written by
Mattias Holmlund and available at http://wiki.xmltv.org/index.php/LineupProposal
and to discussions held on the xmltv-dev mailing list. Some comments
were taken from the xmltv DTD.

Over time channels may be rebranded but continue to show the same content. When
channels are rebranded their XMLTV IDs may be updated to reflect this. Values 
of this element represent the IDs that the channel has been configured with
previously, to allow a seamless transition when the channel's ID is updated.

The value of preferred-preset is the channel number that the user will 
likely prefer to have the channel mapped to on the remote to his computer, or
the channel's EPG number (for digital channels).
