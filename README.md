## Project Status

[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/XMLTV/xmltv.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/github/XMLTV/xmltv)

## Description

The XMLTV project provides a suite of software to gather television listings, process listings data, and help organize your TV viewing.

XMLTV listings use a mature XML file format for storing TV listings, which is defined and documented in the [XMLTV DTD](xmltv.dtd).

In addition to the many "grabbers" that provide listings for large parts of the world, there are also several tools to process and filter these listings.

Please see our [QuickStart](doc/QuickStart) documentation for details on what each program does.

## Changes

To see what has changed in the current XMLTV release please check the [Changes](Changes) file.

## Installation (Package)

### Linux

XMLTV is packaged for most major Linux distributions and FreeBSD. It is recommended that users install XMLTV using their preferred package manager.

#### Debian/Ubuntu

```bash
% sudo apt install xmltv
```

#### Fedora/CentOS (via RPM Fusion)

```bash
% dnf install xmltv
```

### Windows

Windows users are strongly advised to use the [pre-built binary](http://alpha-exe.xmltv.org/) as installing all prerequisites is non-trivial.

For those who want to give it a go, please read the [EXE build instructions](doc/exe_build.html). The instructions can be used for both building xmltv.exe as well as a local install.

### MacOS

XMLTV is packaged for MacOS in the [Fink Project](http://pdb.finkproject.org/pdb/package.php/xmltv)

## Installation (Source)

### Getting Source Code

#### Tarball/Zipfile

The source code for the current release can be downloaded as a tarball (or zipfile) from [GitHub](https://github.com/XMLTV/xmltv/releases/latest) and extracted to a preferred location.

#### Git

The source code for all previous, current and future releases is available in our GitHub repository:

```bash
% git clone https://github.com/XMLTV/xmltv.git
```

### Building

To build from source please ensure all required modules are available (see below). Change to the directory containing the XMLTV source:

```bash
% perl Makefile.PL
% make
% make test
% make install
```

To install to a custom directory, update the first line to provide a suitable `PREFIX` location:

```
% perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/opt/xmltv/
```

The system requirements are Perl 5.8.3 or later, and a few Perl modules. You will be asked about some optional components; if you choose not to install them then there are fewer dependencies.

Please note that in addition to the specific modules listed below, the
`tv_grab_zz_sdjson_sqlite` grabber requires Perl 5.16 to be installed.

When building XMLTV, any missing modules that are required for the selected grabbers/utilities will be reported.

### Recommended distributions/modules

The following modules are recommended but XMLTV works without them installed:

```
File::chdir                      (testing grabbers)
JSON::XS                         (faster JSON handling, see note below)
Lingua::Preferred 0.2.4          (helps with multilingual listings)
Log::TraceMessages               (useful for debugging, not needed for normal use)
PerlIO::gzip                     (can make tv_imdb a bit faster)
Term::ProgressBar                (displays pretty progress bars)
Unicode::String                  (improved character handling in tv_to_latex)
URI::Escape::XS                  (faster URI handling)
```

### JSON libraries

By default, libraries and grabbers that need to handle JSON data should specify the JSON module. This module is a wrapper for JSON::XS-compatible modules and supports the following JSON modules:

```
JSON::XS
JSON::PP
Cpanel::JSON::XS
```

JSON will use JSON::XS if available, falling back to JSON::PP (a core module since 5.14.0) if JSON::XS is not available. Cpanel::JSON::XS can be used as an explicit alternative by setting the PERL_JSON_BACKEND environment variable
(please refer to the JSON module's documentation for details).

### CPAN

All required modules can be quickly installed from CPAN using the `cpanm` utility. For example:

```bash
% cpanm XML::Twig
```

Please note that you may find it easier to search for packaged versions of required modules, as sources which distribute a packaged version of XMLTV also provide packaged versions of required modules.

### Proxy servers

Proxy server support is provide by the LWP modules. You can define a proxy server via the HTTP_PROXY environment variable.

```bash
% HTTP_PROXY=http://somehost.somedomain:port
```

For more information, see this [article](http://search.cpan.org/~gaas/libwww-perl-5.803/lib/LWP/UserAgent.pm#$ua->env_proxy)

## Known issues

If a full HTTP URL to the XMLTV.dtd is provided in the DOCTYPE declaration of an XMLTV document, please be aware that it is possible for the link to instead redirect to a page for accepting cookies. Such cookie-acceptance pages are more common in Europe, and can result in applications being unable to parse the file.
