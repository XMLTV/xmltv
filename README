XMLTV 0.5.4

Gather television listings, process them and organize your viewing.
XMLTV is a file format for storing TV listings, defined in xmltv.dtd.
Then there are several tools to produce and process these listings.

Please see doc/QuickStart for documentation on what each program does,
and xmltv.dtd for documentation on the file format.

* Changes in this release

This release is to fix the grabbers tv_grab_na and tv_grab_sn after
they stopped working.  Special thanks to Stephen Bain for
investigating how to get tv_grab_na working again.

* Known problems

On systems with a UTF-8 locale setting, the Date::Manip module
produces lots of warnings while loading.  This is most often seen with
Red Hat Linux 8.0 which uses UTF-8 locales by default.  For example,
LC_ALL and LANG may be set to 'en_US.UTF-8' instead of just 'en_US'.
Changing them back to 'en_US' stops the warnings, but turns off UTF-8
support in some applications.  This is not really a bug with XMLTV but
more related to the Date::Manip module; the solution given here is
just a workaround.

* Installation

% perl Makefile.PL
% make
% make test
% make install

To install in a custom directory, replace the first line with
something like

% perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/wherever/

The system requirements are perl 5.005_03 or later, and a few Perl
modules.  You will be asked about some optional components; if you
choose not to install them then there are fewer dependencies.  The
full list of needed modules is:

XML::Twig
XML::Writer
Date::Manip
LWP

HTML::Parser       (if you choose to install tv_grab_na)
HTML::TableExtract (if you choose to install tv_grab_sn)
Tk::TableMatrix    (if you choose to install tv_check)
XML::Simple        (if you choose to install tv_check)
CGI                (if you choose to install tv_pick_cgi)

The following modules are recommended, but the software still works
without them:

Memoize                          (makes some programs a bit faster)
Term::ProgressBar                (displays pretty progress meters)
Compress::Zlib                   (makes tv_grab_de a bit faster)
Lingua::Preferred                (helps with multilingual listings)
Unicode::String                  (non-ASCII chars in LaTeX output)
Lingua::EN::Numbers::Ordinate    (not really needed, to be honest)

And the Log::TraceMessages module is useful for debugging, but not
needed for normal use.

All of these, if they aren't included as packages with your OS, can be
installed with tarballs downloaded from CPAN or (hopefully) using the
CPAN shell program: 'perl -MCPAN -e shell', then 'install XML::Twig'
and so on.
