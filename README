XMLTV 0.5.70

Gather television listings, process them and organize your viewing.
XMLTV is a file format for storing TV listings, defined in xmltv.dtd.
Then there are several tools to produce and process these listings.

Please see doc/QuickStart for documentation on what each program does,
and xmltv.dtd for documentation on the file format.

* Major Changes in this release (0.5.70)

tv_grab_eu_egon - removed broken grabber
tv_grab_fi_sv   - re-enable Swedish language listings of Finnish TV channels
tv_grab_sd_json - renamed to tv_grab_zz_sdjson (not country specific)

And lots of other changes (see ChangeLog for details)

* Installation

Note: Windows users are strongly advised to use the pre-built EXE as installing
all the prerequisites is non-trivial. For those who want to give it a go,
instructions are in doc/exe_build.html. Those instructions can be used for both
building xmltv.exe as well as a local install.

Basic installation instructions (Linux/Unix):

% perl Makefile.PL
% make
% make test
% make install

To install in a custom directory, replace the first line with
something like

% perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/wherever/

The system requirements are Perl 5.6 or later, and a few Perl modules.
You will be asked about some optional components; if you choose not to
install them then there are fewer dependencies.  The full list of
required modules is:

LWP 5.65
XML::Parser 2.34
XML::Twig 3.10
XML::Writer 0.4.6
Date::Manip 5.42a 
Memoize (included with Perl 5.8 and later)
Storable (included with Perl 5.8 and later)

DateTime                 (if you want to run tv_grab_dk_dr)
HTML::Parser 3.34        (for grabbers which use HTML::Entities)

IO::File                 (if you want to run tv_grab_fr)
IO::Scalar               (if you want to run tv_grab_uk_bleb, tv_grab_in)
IO::Stringy              (if you want to run tv_grab_se_swedb)
JSON                     (if you want to run tv_grab_fi)
Parse::RecDescent        (if you want to run tv_grab_dk_dr)
SOAP::Lite               (if you want to run tv_grab_na_dd)
Term::ReadKey            (if you want to run tv_grab_na_dd)
Text::Kakasi             (if you want to run tv_grab_jp)
Tk                       (if you want to run tv_check)
Tk::TableMatrix          (if you want to run tv_check)
WWW::Mechanize           (if you want to run tv_grab_na_icons, tv_grab_br_net)
XML::LibXML              (if you want to run tv_grab_se_swedb, tv_grab_in)
Unicode::UTF8simple      (if you want to run tv_grab_pt)

You may have difficulty with the XML modules on Perl 5.8.0 - if so
send mail to the xmltv-users list.  Other Perl versions should be OK.

The following modules are recommended, but the software still works
without them:

Term::ProgressBar                (displays pretty progress meters)
PerlIO::gzip (for perl 5.8+)     (makes tv_imdb a bit faster)
Lingua::Preferred 0.2.4          (helps with multilingual listings)
Unicode::String                  (non-ASCII chars in LaTeX output)
Lingua::EN::Numbers::Ordinate    (not really needed, to be honest)

And the Log::TraceMessages module is useful for debugging, but not
needed for normal use.

All of these can be installed with tarballs downloaded from CPAN or
(hopefully) using the CPAN shell program: 'perl -MCPAN -e shell', then
'install XML::Twig' and so on.  But you may find it easier to search
for packaged versions from your OS vendor or others - places which
distribute a packaged version of XMLTV will often provide the modules
it needs too.

* Proxy servers

Proxy server support is provide by the LWP modules.
You can define a proxy server via the HTTP_PROXY enviornment variable.
    http_proxy=http://somehost.somedomain:port

For more information, see the the following:
http://search.cpan.org/~gaas/libwww-perl-5.803/lib/LWP/UserAgent.pm#$ua->env_proxy

* Known issues

If a full HTTP URL to the XMLTV.dtd is provided in the DOCTYPE declaration of
an XMLTV document, be aware that it is possible for the link to instead
redirect to a page for accepting cookies. Such cookie-acceptance pages are more
common in Europe, and can result in applications being unable to parse the
file.

* Author and copying

This is free software distributed under the GPL, see COPYING. There are many
who have contributed code: they are credited in individual source files and
in the authors.txt mapping file.
