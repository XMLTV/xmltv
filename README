XMLTV 0.5.26

Gather television listings, process them and organize your viewing.
XMLTV is a file format for storing TV listings, defined in xmltv.dtd.
Then there are several tools to produce and process these listings.

Please see doc/QuickStart for documentation on what each program does,
and xmltv.dtd for documentation on the file format.

* Changes in this release

This release is mostly small bugfixes and cleanups.  There is one big
bug that was fixed, where many grabbers would fail close to a year
changeover, but that won't matter again for another 12 months.

Two dependency version increments: XML::Writer version 0.4.1 is now
required, but this is not yet the official CPAN version, see below.
Lingua::Preferred version 0.2.4 is recommended.

tv_grab_uk now has a channel package of Irish channels (feedback
please).  Missing programmes in tv_grab_fi output fixed.  The warning
from tv_grab_na about checking for a newer version is fixed (as you
would expect ;-}).  tv_grab_es includes channel numbers as channel
display-names in the output, but I'm not sure how correct they are
(feedback please).  tv_grab_nl can now be configured for many more
channels.  Fixed --days and --offset in tv_grab_dk and tv_grab_it.

Many small fixes to the libraries and filter programs (tv_sort,
tv_remove_some_overlapping).  Fixed duplicate titles bug in tv_imdb.

tv_grab_de is not working in this release because the upstream data
files are not available.

* Installation

% perl Makefile.PL
% make
% make test
% make install

To install in a custom directory, replace the first line with
something like

% perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/wherever/

The system requirements are perl 5.6 or later, and a few Perl modules.
You will be asked about some optional components; if you choose not to
install them then there are fewer dependencies.  The full list of
needed modules is:

XML::Parser 2.34
XML::Twig 3.09
XML::Writer 0.4.1 - nonstandard release, see below
Date::Manip 5.42a 
LWP 5.65
Memoize (included with perl 5.8 and later)

HTML::Parser 3.34       (if you want to run tv_grab_na)
HTML::TreeBuilder       (for many of the grabbers)
Tk::TableMatrix         (if you want to run tv_check)
XML::Simple             (if you want to run tv_check)
CGI                     (if you want to use tv_pick_cgi)

Where a version number is given any later version also ought to work.

XML::Writer 0.4.1 is an unofficial bugfix release which you can get as
<http://cpan.org/modules/by-authors/id/E/ED/EDAVIS/XML-Writer-0.4.1.tar.gz>.
It might become the official latest version at some point.

The following modules are recommended, but the software still works
without them:

Term::ProgressBar                (displays pretty progress meters)
PerlIO::gzip (for perl 5.8+)     (makes tv_imdb a bit faster)
Compress::Zlib                   (makes tv_grab_de a bit faster)
Lingua::Preferred 0.2.4          (helps with multilingual listings)
Unicode::String                  (non-ASCII chars in LaTeX output)
Lingua::EN::Numbers::Ordinate    (not really needed, to be honest)

And the Log::TraceMessages module is useful for debugging, but not
needed for normal use.

All of these can be installed with tarballs downloaded from CPAN or
(hopefully) using the CPAN shell program: 'perl -MCPAN -e shell', then
'install XML::Twig' and so on.  But you may find it easier to search
for packaged versions from your OS vendor or others - places which
distribute a packaged version of xmltv will often provide the modules
it needs too.
