XMLTV 0.5.21

Gather television listings, process them and organize your viewing.
XMLTV is a file format for storing TV listings, defined in xmltv.dtd.
Then there are several tools to produce and process these listings.

Please see doc/QuickStart for documentation on what each program does,
and xmltv.dtd for documentation on the file format.

* Changes in this release

This 0.5.21 release is to fix a bug in 'make test'.  In all other
respects it is the same as 0.5.20, which has the following changes
from 0.5.19:

Fixed a bug that affected many grabbers with the switch from summer to
winter time.  The time and timezone should now be correct in the
output of tv_grab_dk, tv_grab_es, tv_grab_fi, tv_grab_hu, tv_grab_it,
tv_grab_nl, and tv_grab_sn.  (Sourceforge bug #831487)

The build process now respects DESTDIR, eg for building packages.
(Sourceforge bug #82002)

Fixed test failure when LANG is not 'en'. (Debian bug #213948)

Fixed crash in tv_grab_hu.

tv_grab_nz works once again with Python 1.5.2.

Small tv_grab_na bug fixes: no '1' or '$opt_configure' warnings;
recognizes more languages.

Fixed a couple of characters in tv_grab_sn output.

Bug fix for XMLTV::write_programme() so it doesn't alter the hash
passed in.

Changes to tv_imdb including narrators, hosts, and links directly to
the imdb.com page for a programme.  You will need to rerun --prepStage
3 and 5 to update an existing database.

A new filter tv_remove_some_overlapping gets rid of the 'umbrella'
programmes that appear in some listings sources, programmes whose only
purpose is to contain others.

tv_grab_de is not working in this release because the upstream data
files are not available.

* Installation

% perl Makefile.PL
% make
% make test
% make install

To install in a custom directory, replace the first line with
something like

% perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/wherever/

The system requirements are perl 5.6 or later, and a few Perl modules.
You will be asked about some optional components; if you choose not to
install them then there are fewer dependencies.  The full list of
needed modules is:

XML::Twig 3.09
XML::Writer
Date::Manip 5.42a 
LWP 5.65
Memoize (included with perl 5.8 and later)

HTML::Parser            (if you want to run tv_grab_na)
HTML::TableExtract 1.08 (if you want to run tv_grab_sn)
HTML::TreeBuilder       (for many of the grabbers)
Tk::TableMatrix         (if you want to run tv_check)
XML::Simple             (if you want to run tv_check)
CGI                     (if you want to use tv_pick_cgi)

Where a version number is given any later version also ought to work.

The following modules are recommended, but the software still works
without them:

Term::ProgressBar                (displays pretty progress meters)
Compress::Zlib                   (makes tv_grab_de, tv_imdb a bit faster)
Lingua::Preferred                (helps with multilingual listings)
Unicode::String                  (non-ASCII chars in LaTeX output)
Lingua::EN::Numbers::Ordinate    (not really needed, to be honest)

And the Log::TraceMessages module is useful for debugging, but not
needed for normal use.

All of these can be installed with tarballs downloaded from CPAN or
(hopefully) using the CPAN shell program: 'perl -MCPAN -e shell', then
'install XML::Twig' and so on.  But you may find it easier to search
for packaged versions from your OS vendor or others - places which
distribute a packaged version of xmltv will often provide the modules
it needs too.

Installing a nonstandard release of Date::Manip is no longer needed
since the official version (as of 5.42a) includes the needed bugfixes.
