XMLTV 0.5.30

Gather television listings, process them and organize your viewing.
XMLTV is a file format for storing TV listings, defined in xmltv.dtd.
Then there are several tools to produce and process these listings.

Please see doc/QuickStart for documentation on what each program does,
and xmltv.dtd for documentation on the file format.

* Changes in this release

New grabbers for Japan (tv_grab_jp by Takeru Komoriya), Germany
(tv_grab_de_tvtoday by Stefan Siegl), Sweden (tv_grab_se by Mattias
Holmlund), and France (tv_grab_fr by Sylvain Fabre).

tv_grab_uk_rt now supports radio channels (patch by Dan Sheridan).

tv_grab_na --list-channels works again.

Fixed XMLTV.pm library bug with reading and writing <subtitles>
element.

XML::Writer 0.4.6 is now required and some of the new grabbers have
their own module requirements listed below.

* Installation

% perl Makefile.PL
% make
% make test
% make install

To install in a custom directory, replace the first line with
something like

% perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/wherever/

The system requirements are perl 5.6 or later, and a few Perl modules.
You will be asked about some optional components; if you choose not to
install them then there are fewer dependencies.  The full list of
needed modules is:

XML::Parser 2.34
XML::Twig 3.09
XML::Writer 0.4.6
Date::Manip 5.42a 
LWP 5.65
Memoize (included with perl 5.8 and later)
Storable (included with perl 5.8 and later)

HTML::TreeBuilder       (for many of the grabbers)
HTML::Parser 3.34       (for some of the grabbers)
Tk::TableMatrix         (if you want to run tv_check)
CGI                     (if you want to run tv_pick_cgi)
Text::Kakasi            (if you want to run tv_grab_jp)
XML::LibXML             (if you want to run tv_grab_se)

Where a version number is given any later version also ought to work.
You may have difficulty with the XML modules on perl 5.8.0 - if so
send mail to the xmltv-users list.  Other perl versions should be OK.

The following modules are recommended, but the software still works
without them:

Term::ProgressBar                (displays pretty progress meters)
PerlIO::gzip (for perl 5.8+)     (makes tv_imdb a bit faster)
Lingua::Preferred 0.2.4          (helps with multilingual listings)
Unicode::String                  (non-ASCII chars in LaTeX output)
Lingua::EN::Numbers::Ordinate    (not really needed, to be honest)

And the Log::TraceMessages module is useful for debugging, but not
needed for normal use.

All of these can be installed with tarballs downloaded from CPAN or
(hopefully) using the CPAN shell program: 'perl -MCPAN -e shell', then
'install XML::Twig' and so on.  But you may find it easier to search
for packaged versions from your OS vendor or others - places which
distribute a packaged version of xmltv will often provide the modules
it needs too.
