XMLTV 0.2.10

$Id$

Suite of programs for processing TV listings and organizing your
viewing.

You can grab TV listings for the USA, Canada and the UK.  They are
stored in an XML format.  Then you can sort them, filter them and
print them out.  There is a CGI script to help automate choosing what
to watch.

(TV listings for the Netherlands have rotted, because the website they
were grabbed from has changed its format.  Listings for Austria are
also temporarily unavailable.)

This release has bugfixes and small enrichments to the file format.

It's still rough round the edges, but if you are comfortable
using a command line and want to take control of your TV viewing, it
could be useful.

added \$Id \$ as approprate

Revision 1.15  2001/11/11 16:44:19  epaepa
Whoops, just realized that the last changelog message would itself get
keyword-expanded, causing no end of confusion.  I had to perform some
emergency censorship of funny dollar signs.

Revision 1.14  2001/11/11 16:41:05  epaepa
Rearranged (or added) comments at the start of each file, so the
description is near the top and the changelog near the bottom.  Added
Log: lines to get an automatically updated changelog from now on; I
hope it works.
