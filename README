XMLTV 0.5.70

Gather television listings, process them and organize your viewing.
XMLTV is a file format for storing TV listings, defined in xmltv.dtd.
Then there are several tools to produce and process these listings.

Please see doc/QuickStart for documentation on what each program does,
and xmltv.dtd for documentation on the file format.

* Major Changes in this release (0.5.70)

tv_grab_eu_egon - removed broken grabber
tv_grab_fi_sv   - re-enable Swedish language listings of Finnish TV channels
tv_grab_sd_json - renamed to tv_grab_zz_sdjson (not country specific)

And lots of other changes (see ChangeLog for details)

* Installation

Note: Windows users are strongly advised to use the pre-built EXE as installing
all the prerequisites is non-trivial. For those who want to give it a go,
instructions are in doc/exe_build.html. Those instructions can be used for both
building xmltv.exe as well as a local install.

Basic installation instructions (Linux/Unix):

% perl Makefile.PL
% make
% make test
% make install

To install in a custom directory, replace the first line with
something like

% perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/wherever/

The system requirements are Perl 5.8.3 or later, and a few Perl modules.
You will be asked about some optional components; if you choose not to
install them then there are fewer dependencies.

Please note that in addition to the specific modules listed below, the
tv_grab_zz_sdjson_sqlite grabber requires Perl 5.16 to be installed.

** Recommended distribtions/modules

The following modules are recommended (e.g. faster JSON processing, better
character handling) but the software will works without them installed:

File::chdir                      (testing grabbers)
JSON::XS                         (faster JSON handling, see note below)
Lingua::Preferred 0.2.4          (helps with multilingual listings)
Log::TraceMessages               (useful for debugging, not needed for normal use)
PerlIO::gzip                     (can make tv_imdb a bit faster)
Term::ProgressBar                (displays pretty progress bars)
Unicode::String                  (improved character handling in tv_to_latex)

** JSON libraries

By default, libraries and grabbers that need to handle JSON data should specify
the JSON module. This module is a wrapper for JSON::XS-compatible modules and
supports the following JSON modules:

JSON::XS
JSON::PP
Cpanel::JSON::XS

JSON will use JSON::XS if available, falling back to JSON::PP (a core module
since 5.14.0) if JSON::XS is not available. Cpanel::JSON::XS can be used as an
explicit alternative by setting the PERL_JSON_BACKEND environment variable
(please refer to the JSON module's documentation for details).


All required modules can can be installed from CPAN using the CPAN shell program:

% 'perl -MCPAN -e shell'

then 'install XML::Twig' and so on.

You may find it easier to search for packaged versions of modules from your OS
provider - software sources which distribute a packaged version of XMLTV will
often provide the modules it needs too.

* Proxy servers

Proxy server support is provide by the LWP modules.
You can define a proxy server via the HTTP_PROXY enviornment variable.
    http_proxy=http://somehost.somedomain:port

For more information, see the the following:
http://search.cpan.org/~gaas/libwww-perl-5.803/lib/LWP/UserAgent.pm#$ua->env_proxy

* Known issues

If a full HTTP URL to the XMLTV.dtd is provided in the DOCTYPE declaration of
an XMLTV document, be aware that it is possible for the link to instead
redirect to a page for accepting cookies. Such cookie-acceptance pages are more
common in Europe, and can result in applications being unable to parse the
file.

* Author and copying

This is free software distributed under the GPL, see COPYING. There are many
who have contributed code: they are credited in individual source files and
in the authors.txt mapping file.
