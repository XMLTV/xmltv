XMLTV 0.5.70

Gather television listings, process them and organize your viewing.
XMLTV is a file format for storing TV listings, defined in xmltv.dtd.
Then there are several tools to produce and process these listings.

Please see doc/QuickStart for documentation on what each program does,
and xmltv.dtd for documentation on the file format.

* Major Changes in this release (0.5.70) 

tv_grab_eu_egon - removed broken grabber
tv_grab_fi_sv   - re-enable Swidish language linstings of Finnish TV channels
tv_grab_sd_json - renamed to tv_grab_zz_sdjson (not country specific)

And lots of other changes (see ChangeLog for details)

* Installation

Note: Windows users are strongly advised to use the pre-built EXE as installing
all the prerequisites is non-trivial. For those who want to give it a go,
instructions are in doc/exe_build.html. Those instructions can be used for both
building xmltv.exe as well as a local install.

Basic installation instructions (Linux/Unix):

% perl Makefile.PL
% make
% make test
% make install

To install in a custom directory, replace the first line with
something like

% perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/wherever/

The system requirements are Perl 5.6 or later, and a few Perl modules.
You will be asked about some optional components; if you choose not to
install them then there are fewer dependencies.  The full list of
required modules is:

LWP 5.65
XML::Parser 2.34
XML::Twig 3.10
XML::Writer 0.4.6
Date::Manip 5.42a

IO::Scalar               (if you want to run tv_grab_uk_bleb, tv_grab_in)
IO::Stringy              (if you want to run tv_grab_se_swedb)
JSON                     (if you want to run tv_grab_fi)
Parse::RecDescent        (if you want to run tv_grab_dk_dr)
SOAP::Lite               (if you want to run tv_grab_na_dd)
Term::ReadKey            (if you want to run tv_grab_na_dd)
Text::Kakasi             (if you want to run tv_grab_jp)
Tk                       (if you want to run tv_check)
Tk::TableMatrix          (if you want to run tv_check)
WWW::Mechanize           (if you want to run tv_grab_na_icons, tv_grab_br_net)
XML::LibXML              (if you want to run tv_grab_se_swedb, tv_grab_in)
Unicode::UTF8simple      (if you want to run tv_grab_pt)

You may have difficulty with the XML modules on Perl 5.8.0 - if so
send mail to the xmltv-users list.  Other Perl versions should be OK.

The following modules are recommended, but the software still works
without them:

Term::ProgressBar                (displays pretty progress meters)
PerlIO::gzip (for perl 5.8+)     (makes tv_imdb a bit faster)
Lingua::Preferred 0.2.4          (helps with multilingual listings)
Unicode::String                  (non-ASCII chars in LaTeX output)
Lingua::EN::Numbers::Ordinate    (not really needed, to be honest)

And the Log::TraceMessages module is useful for debugging, but not
needed for normal use.

All of these can be installed with tarballs downloaded from CPAN or
(hopefully) using the CPAN shell program: 'perl -MCPAN -e shell', then
'install XML::Twig' and so on.  But you may find it easier to search
for packaged versions from your OS vendor or others - places which
distribute a packaged version of XMLTV will often provide the modules
it needs too.

* Proxy servers

Proxy server support is provide by the LWP modules.
You can define a proxy server via the HTTP_PROXY enviornment variable.
    http_proxy=http://somehost.somedomain:port

For more information, see the the following:
http://search.cpan.org/~gaas/libwww-perl-5.803/lib/LWP/UserAgent.pm#$ua->env_proxy

* Known issues

tv_grab_se_swedb sometimes fails to work on Windows if there are spaces
in the path to your home-directory. This can be avoided by setting
the environment variable HOME to a path without spaces (e.g. c:\home).

If a full HTTP URL to the XMLTV.dtd is provided in the DOCTYPE declaration of
an XMLTV document, be aware that it is possible for the link to instead
redirect to a page for accepting cookies. Such cookie-acceptance pages are more
common in Europe, and can result in applications being unable to parse the file.

* Author and copying

This is free software distributed under the GPL, see COPYING.  But if
you would like to use the code under some other conditions, please do
ask.  There are many who have contributed code, they are credited in
individual source files.

There is a web page at http://www.xmltv.org  and a Sourceforge
project 'XMLTV'.  There are some mailing lists:

    xmltv-announce@lists.sourceforge.net
    xmltv-users@lists.sourceforge.net
    xmltv-devel@lists.sourceforge.net

You ought to subscribe to the announce list at least.  Contact the
users list with most problems.
