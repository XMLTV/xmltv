XMLTV 0.5.18

Gather television listings, process them and organize your viewing.
XMLTV is a file format for storing TV listings, defined in xmltv.dtd.
Then there are several tools to produce and process these listings.

Please see doc/QuickStart for documentation on what each program does,
and xmltv.dtd for documentation on the file format.

* Changes in this release

A fix to tv_grab_na to avoid crashes (probably caused by a bug in
perl) when choosing a provider with a large range of channels.  This
does not fix the bug for all users but it seems to for most.  I hope
to track down the cause of this problem and fix it fully in a later
release.  Also fixed the grabber for some minor site changes.

tv_grab_nz is working again, but tv_grab_de is disabled in this
release because the upstream server has stopped generating listings.

tv_grab_it generates lowercase channel ids and configuration correctly
skips over 'dud channels' which exist on the site but have no
listings.

tv_grab_hu no longer generates incorrect stop times for some
programmes; in fact it does not output stop times at all, since the
site does not provide them.  If you would like stop times to be
guessed from the following programme on the same channel, please
filter through tv_sort.  Also tv_grab_nl_wolf now discards
obviously-bad stop times in its upstream listings.

tv_grep now supports --not to negate the meaning of the following
predicate.

* Installation

% perl Makefile.PL
% make
% make test
% make install

To install in a custom directory, replace the first line with
something like

% perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/wherever/

The system requirements are perl 5.6 or later, and a few Perl modules.
You will be asked about some optional components; if you choose not to
install them then there are fewer dependencies.  The full list of
needed modules is:

XML::Twig 3.09
XML::Writer
Date::Manip 5.42a 
LWP 5.65
Memoize (included with perl 5.8 and later)

HTML::Parser            (if you want to run tv_grab_na)
HTML::TableExtract 1.08 (if you want to run tv_grab_sn)
HTML::TreeBuilder       (for many of the grabbers)
Tk::TableMatrix         (if you want to run tv_check)
XML::Simple             (if you want to run tv_check)
CGI                     (if you want to use tv_pick_cgi)

Where a version number is given any later version also ought to work.

The following modules are recommended, but the software still works
without them:

Term::ProgressBar                (displays pretty progress meters)
Compress::Zlib                   (makes tv_grab_de, tv_imdb a bit faster)
Lingua::Preferred                (helps with multilingual listings)
Unicode::String                  (non-ASCII chars in LaTeX output)
Lingua::EN::Numbers::Ordinate    (not really needed, to be honest)

And the Log::TraceMessages module is useful for debugging, but not
needed for normal use.

All of these can be installed with tarballs downloaded from CPAN or
(hopefully) using the CPAN shell program: 'perl -MCPAN -e shell', then
'install XML::Twig' and so on.  But you may find it easier to search
for packaged versions from your OS vendor or others - places which
distribute a packaged version of xmltv will often provide the modules
it needs too.

Installing a nonstandard release of Date::Manip is no longer needed
since the official version (as of 5.42a) includes the needed bugfixes.
