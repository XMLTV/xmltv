XMLTV 0.4.4

Gather television listings, process them and organize your viewing.
XMLTV is a file format for storing TV listings, defined in xmltv.dtd.
Then there are several tools to produce and process these listings.

Changes: This release contains bugfixes and a couple of new filter
programs, tv_grep and tv_extractinfo_en.  And all the tools have been
renamed since 0.4.3, so they have more consistent names: for example
the old sort_listings is now called tv_sort.  filter_shown has been
removed, its functionality is covered by 'tv_grep --on-after now'.

Please see doc/QuickStart for documentation on what each program does,
and xmltv.dtd for documentation on the file format.

* Installation

The system requirements are perl 5.005_03 or later, and a great many
Perl modules.  The modules needed are:

XML::DOM
XML::Writer
Date::Manip
LWP
Log::TraceMessages
Term::ProgressBar
Lingua::Preferred
Tie::IxHash
Compress::Zlib
Lingua::EN::Numbers::Ordinate
Memoize
Storable
Tk::TableMatrix
XML::Simple
Unicode::String

All of these can be installed with tarballs downloaded from CPAN, or
(hopefully) using the CPAN shell program: 'perl -MCPAN -e shell', then
'install XML::DOM' and so on.  Not every module is needed for every
program, they are listed in approximate order of importance, but you
will need at least the first half of this list.

No installation
